# La forge technical test

You have **1 week** from the moment you receive this mail to submit your test ( if you finish before, please do send it).

In order to submit, please send all required materials (source code, links, and instructions on how to run) at this email: contact@la-forge.co along with your full name. You can also send an email at the adress if you have questions regarding the test


## Instructions

Based on the [Mockups](https://www.figma.com/file/r6T7e9jQaqQk1KwQTIlsrV/Pokedex?node-id=0%3A1), create a website which will be accessible online.

**Technical notes**:

- React Front end (web or RN / expo)

- Typescript optional (but recommended)
  
- Responsive not required (either desktop only or mobile only will be ok)
  
- Back end of your choosing
  
- Pokemons data should be served from the back end (you will have to import the pokemons.json file in your back end)

- You can easily deploy your website for free services (*netlify* for front end, *heroku* and *firebase* for back end)
  
<br/>


This website shall contain:

## The Homescreen ("pokedex")

- lists all pokemons (see mockups)
  
- Allows the user to filter them by name, level or type (& combine the filters)
  
- Each pokemon card can be "liked" and "liked" pokemons will be saved online: when acessing the link from another browser, liked pokemons should still be there


<br/>


## The Detailed View

On the Homescreen, when clicking on a pokemon card, a modal should appear, showing the detailed view of this pokemon. It is up to you to choose which data to display and how to display it (style).

<br/>

> This is the part where you can go crazy and unleash your creativity

<br/>

## Liked Pokemons View

This view lists all liked pokemons.

<br/>


> Particular attention will be brought to accuracy of the website to the designs provided (Besides the detail view of course).

### Good luck !
